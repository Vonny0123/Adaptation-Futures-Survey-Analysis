# Adaptation-Futures-Survey-Analysis

This document outlines the results of analysis of the results of a survey sent to people who had attended the adaptation futures conference in 2018. The goal of the HECC section is to assess how research into high end climate change (HECC, ie. Anything to do with warming of greater than 2 degrees) has changed since the same survey was taken two years previously. We also look into how the responses compare between different types of organisations and different locations using various techniques. The impressions section is some work I completed in creating visualisations of peoples responses to questions about the event itself.
